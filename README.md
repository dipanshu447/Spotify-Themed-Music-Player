# 🎵 Spotify-Themed Music Player

A fully responsive and interactive music player designed with a Spotify-inspired UI.

## 🎯 Primary Goal

The primary goal of this project was to enhance my JavaScript knowledge by working on a real, interactive project. Through this, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of event handling, the `Audio` object, DOM manipulation, and responsive UI design.

## 🌟 Learning Experience

Working on this project has been an amazing experience! Implementing play/pause functionality, volume control, and track navigation allowed me to explore the JavaScript `Audio` object and its properties in depth. I learned a lot of new concepts and gained hands-on experience in handling audio in web applications. 

This project has motivated me to dive deeper into Web APIs, and I plan to build even cooler projects in the future using them! 🚀

## 🚀 Features

- 🎶 Play, pause, and control music volume
- ⏭️ Next and Previous track functionality
- 📂 Dynamic album management (Just add a folder with a cover photo and `info.json` file containing title and description)
- 📱 Fully responsive design for all devices
- 🎨 Attractive UI with smooth animations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- No external APIs used
